  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a software engineer, currently I mostly program in JavaScript but I like
    programming languages and have built things with C#, Ruby and Clojure. I'm
    interested in functional programming, concurrency, databases and browser apps
    among other things.

    I live in London and I like exploring, especially industrial, derlict and forgotten areas.

  <p>
    I wear glasses. I drink too much coffee. I play old computer games.
